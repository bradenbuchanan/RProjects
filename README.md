## RProjects: R Programming Practice Repository

Welcome to my `RProjects` repository! The primary aim of this repository is to practice and enhance my R programming skills, specifically harnessing the power of the `tidyverse`. 

### Objectives

1. **Descriptive Statistics**: Delve into the heart of datasets to understand their structure, main characteristics, and patterns.
   
2. **Inferential Statistics**: Draw conclusions from the datasets and test hypotheses to make data-driven decisions.

3. **Data Manipulation**: Practice the art of wrangling datasets, transforming them to fit the needs of specific analyses.

4. **Learning from Data**: Beyond technical skills, understand what the data tells and the story it portrays.

### Data Source

The datasets used in this repository are sourced from the `tidyTuesday` project and custom data sets I make using simulated data. 

### What to Expect

- Weekly updates with new datasets.
- Visualizations to complement statistical findings.
- Periodic reflections on what I learned from each dataset.

### Contributions

While the primary goal of this repo is personal learning and practice, suggestions, feedback, or insights on any of the analyses are more than welcome! Feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
